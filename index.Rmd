## Download Tutorial Materials ##

To avoid network issues at the tutorial and to help get things started off smoothly, please download the required packages and data sets listed below prior to the tutorial.

1. If you do not already have the most recent version of R, (version 3.2), please [download](http://cran.r-project.org) and install it.

2. You will need a recent version of the Firefox or Chrome browser installed on your computer.

3. Open R and execute the following commands to install Tessera and other libraries you'll need for the tutorials:

    ```r
    options(repos = c(tessera = "http://packages.tessera.io",
      getOption("repos")))

    install.packages(c("datadr", "trelliscope", "rbokeh",
      "housingData", "lubridate"))
    ```

To test your installation, you can load R and try the following commands:

```r
library(trelliscope)
library(rbokeh)
library(housingData)

panel <- function(x)
  figure() %>% ly_points(time, medListPriceSqft, data = x)

housing %>%
  qtrellis(by = c("county", "state"), panel, layout = c(2, 4))
```

This should bring up an interactive trelliscope display in your web browser.

## Additional Reading Material ##
