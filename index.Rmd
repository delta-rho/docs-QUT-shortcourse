# Tessera Short Course #

This is the landing page for the short course "Analysis and Visualization of Large Complex Data with Tessera" that will be given at Queensland University of Technology on February 17, 2016 from 9am to 5pm.  It will be very similar to a short course given last October at UTS.

<!-- ## Slides ##

The slides for the short course are located here: [http://slides.com/hafen/tessera-uts2015/](http://slides.com/hafen/tessera-uts2015/).

## Download Tutorial Materials ##

Due to the number of registerants, to avoid network issues at the tutorial and to help get things started off smoothly, please download the required packages and data sets listed below prior to the tutorial.

1. If you do not already have the most recent version of R, (version 3.2), please [download](http://cran.r-project.org) and install it.

2. You will need a recent version of the Firefox or Chrome browser installed on your computer.

3. Open R and execute the following commands to install Tessera and other libraries you'll need for the tutorials:

    ```r
    options(repos = c(tessera = "http://packages.tessera.io",
      getOption("repos")))

    # also try this if packages.tessera.io isn't working:
    # options(repos = c(tessera = "http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/packages/",
    #  getOption("repos")))

    install.packages(c("datadr", "trelliscope", "rbokeh",
      "housingData", "lubridate"))
    ```

4. Download and unzip the data and code examples: [http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/qut2015/tessera_shortcourse.zip](http://ml.stat.purdue.edu/qut2015/tessera_shortcourse.zip).

To test your installation, you can load R and try the following commands:

```r
library(trelliscope)
library(rbokeh)
library(housingData)

panel <- function(x)
  figure() %>% ly_points(time, medListPriceSqft, data = x)

housing %>%
  qtrellis(by = c("county", "state"), panel, layout = c(2, 4))
```

This should bring up an interactive trelliscope display in your web browser.

## Optional Setup ##

While all of the hands-on examples have been designed to work on your laptop, we will provide an example of running on a cluster on Amazon Web Services.  This will mainly be a demonstration, but if you would like to follow along, you can visit [here](https://github.com/tesseradata/install-emr) to get an account with AWS set up.  Note that this may require some advanced knowledge of using a terminal, etc.

## Additional Reading Material ##

If you want to read up on any of the Tessera components prior to the tutorial, you can look at the [references section on tessera.io](http://tessera.io/#references).
